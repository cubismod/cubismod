## Ryan Wallace (he/him)
### Site Reliability Engineer at Red Hat

Howdy, I'm an SRE working on the [AppSRE team](https://github.com/app-sre) at Red Hat. 

Day to day I am working on the tooling for our OpenShift based application platform, letting other teams at Red Hat run their services in a cloud-native way.
